# text-semantic-similarity-model
This repository contains the code for a text semantic similarity calculator app that uses a trained random forest regressor model to accurately predict the similarity between two input texts. The app is built using Streamlit and also includes a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the input texts into numerical representations.
